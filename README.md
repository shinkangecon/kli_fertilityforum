  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | This paper studies the impact of a father-specific parental leave policy on labor market outcomes. In 2006, Quebec reformed their parental leave policy to include up to three weeks of paid paternity leave that is not transferable to the mother. Using a state-level difference-in-difference approach, we find that the so-called daddy quota increased the probability of employment for women and decreased the wage of younger men. In a theoretical framework, we show that policy-driven changes in gender norms are consistent with our findings. The results suggest that daddy quota promoted equal opportunities for women in the labor market.

  </summary>
  
  | **Abstract**          |
  |:---------------------------|
  | This paper examines the impact of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) on the children of single mothers. While the EITC is typically thought to benefit low-income
children by increasing family income, it may also decrease caregiving inputs as a result of increased parental labor supply. Children of single mothers may be particularly sensitive to such decreases due to the lack of other parental support. Using a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to look at the impact of the 1993 EITC expansion, I find that EITC expansion reduces the combined math and reading test scores of children of single mothers by 13.61 percent of a standard deviation. The most important mechanism is reduced mother-child interactions due to the increased maternal labor supply. These results suggest that for the EITC to be an effective poverty reduction tool, it may need to be paired with other interventions such as child care.
